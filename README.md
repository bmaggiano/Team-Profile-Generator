# Team Profile Generator

## Description

This app allows a user to input data about their current team of software engineers. The user will run npm i, then node index. From there, the user will be prompted with a series of questions. First the user will enter data about the manager, then the user will enter info about any engineers or interns that are also apart of this team. 

After the user has finished entering their team's info, an HTML page will be generated with the users team and their info. A decent understanding of Node.js, inquirer, constructor functions, testing with Jest, and advanced vanilla javascript all come into play with this application. As well as having a solid backbone css framework like Bootstrap.

## Installation

Installation requires a user to run npm i to install the necessary dependencies in our package.json file. We used npm inquirer@8.2.4 for our prompt modules, npm i jest for our unit testing, and finally using the terminal we run node index.js.

## Credits

We would like to give credit to Jest for unit testing, Inquire for prompt modules, and Bootstrap for our CSS Framework.
